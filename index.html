                    <h1>WELCOME TO DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>

                    <p>The Department of Computer Science at the University of Jaffna is one of the remarkable centres of teaching and research in Computer Science in Sri Lanka celebrating its 30 Years of Computing. There are currently over 330 undergraduate and few postgraduate students studying within the Department. The Department aims to collaborate in its activities with the IT industrial sector across the country in research and teaching.</br></br>

                    The Department of Computer Science (DCS) was established in early 1991 in the Faculty of Science, University of Jaffna, introducing Computer Science as a subject for the Physical Science students. In 2007, the DCS commenced a new degree programme named as Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science (BSc in Computer Science) for the students who are directly admitted by the UGC under the Computer Science (Direct-intake) stream. In 2015, an extended fourth year Applied Science degree in Computing was introduced for the Physical Science students who could not get in to the special degree programme in Computer Science.</br></br>

                    The DCS contributes at its best to the development of higher education of the nation. The Computer Science study programmes at the DCS have good track records for more than two decades for their curricula and the quality graduates they produce. The undergraduate student population of the DCS in year 2018 was about 325 including four foreign students from Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, and the postgraduate student population was seven. The population comprises all three ethnic groups: Sinhalese (45%), Tamils (46%) and Muslims (9%). The DCS receives the services of 10 permanent academic staff, two permanent academic support staff, and four non-academic staff. The department maintains a good industry linkage with leading IT companies such as WSO2, Virtusa, 99X Technology, IFS, and hSenid Mobile Solutions in teaching and learning processes since year 2011.</br></br>

                    Academic staff of the Department drafted the syllabi for the above three degree programmes, which have been regularly revised as per ACM/IEEE guidelines in order to cater the changing needs of the contemporary world, in consultation with experts from reputed universities and IT industries.</br></br>

                    At present the DCS is housed in a portion of the Mathematics Block. This year DCS has commenced the construction work of its first permanent new building and other related structures through the World Bank funded AHEAD project. The construction work is awarded to M/S Sanken Constructions. At present, the lack of space is a major cause for restricting the number of students admitting to offer computer science as a subject. There is a need to increase the intake into such a demanded subject stream. On a positive side, the increase in intake of students will increase the number of qualified graduates satisfying the national and global demands. We expect to occupy the new building in the mid of year 2021.</br></br>
